# Coronavirus-Visualization
Choropleth maps to visualize some coronavirus trends.

Github renders the .ipynb statically and so the maps don't show up. To view the visualizations visit https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/peter-feeney/Coronavirus-Visualization/blob/master/coronavirus-visualization.ipynb. 

Here are a few snapshots from the maps I produced but I really recommend going to the above link to see them:
